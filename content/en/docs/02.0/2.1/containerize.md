  Containerize an application.
---

The main goal of this lab is to show you how to containerize a Java application. Including deployment on OpenShift and exposing the service with a route. In this example, we want to build a microservice-based on [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), which produces random data when it’s REST interface is called. Another Quarkus microservice consumes then the data and exposes it to its endpoint.

```
+----------+                    +----------+
| producer +<-------------------+ consumer +
+----------+                    +----------+
```

Some words about Quarkus:

{{% alert  color="primary" %}}
“Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for GraalVM & OpenJDK HotSpot, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Also focused on developer experience, making things just work with little to no configuration and allowing to do live coding.” - [quarkus.io](https://quarkus.io/)
{{% /alert %}}

In short, Quarkus brings a framework built upon JakartaEE standards to build microservices in the Java environment. Per default, Quarkus comes with full CDI integration, RESTeasy-JAX-RS, dev mode and many more features.

If you wanna know more about Quarkus, you can checkout our [Puzzle Quarkus Techlab](https://puzzle.github.io/quarkus-techlab/)

The source code of our Quarkus applications is available on Github:

* [Consumer](https://github.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-consumer)
* [Producer](https://github.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer)


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Inspect Dockerfile

First, we need a Dockerfile that defines the application transformation from source code to a container image.

To build the producer, we make use of the Docker Multistage build feature. In the first stage, we use the [centOS Quarkus image](https://quay.io/repository/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven?tag=20.1.0-java11) and perform a Quarkus native build. The resulting binary will be used in the second build stage. For the second stage, we use the UBI minimal image.
(see [best practices](https://gitea.techlab.openshift.ch/APPUiO-AMM-Techlab/docs/02.0/additional/container-best-practices/bestpractise/#use-multistage-build) for more information on Multistage builds)

```Dockerfile
## Stage 1 : build with maven builder image with native capabilities
FROM quay.io/quarkus/centos-quarkus-maven:20.1.0-java11 AS build
COPY pom.xml /usr/src/app/
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml -B de.qaware.maven:go-offline-maven-plugin:1.2.5:resolve-dependencies
COPY src /usr/src/app/src
USER root
RUN chown -R quarkus /usr/src/app
USER quarkus
RUN mvn -f /usr/src/app/pom.xml -Pnative clean package

## Stage 2 : create the docker final image
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
WORKDIR /work/
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/target/*-runner /work/application

# set up permissions for user `1001`
RUN chmod 775 /work /work/application \
  && chown -R 1001 /work \
  && chmod -R "g+rwX" /work \
  && chown -R 1001:root /work

EXPOSE 8080
USER 1001

CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer/master/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage)

Because the build needs a huge amount of memory (>8GB) and takes a lot of time (+5min) we refrain from building the app from source. Instead, we take the pre-built Quarkus app from the Github release page.

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
WORKDIR /work/

# Install wget
RUN yum install wget -y

# Fetch the latest binary release from the GutHub release page
RUN wget https://github.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer/releases/download/1.0.0-rest/application

RUN chmod -R 775 /work
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
CMD ["./application", "-Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0"]
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer/rest/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.binary)

This Dockerfile will be used to build the image inside OpenShift.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Create ImageStream

We configure an [ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html) for the image that we will build inside OpenShift. ImageStream is an abstraction for referencing images from within OpenShift Container Platform. Simplified the ImageStream tracks changes for the defined images and reacts by triggering a new Build. This image reference will also be used to deploy the application.

Prepare a file inside your workspace `<workspace>/imageStream.yaml` and add the following resource configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1
kind: ImageStream
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewBuild
  labels:
    build: data-producer
    application: amm-techlab
  name: data-producer
spec:
  lookupPolicy:
    local: false
status:
  dockerImageRepository: ""
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/imageStream.yaml)

Let's create the ImageStream

```BASH
oc apply -f imageStream.yaml
```

```
imagestream.image.openshift.io/data-producer created
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Create BuildConfig

In this section, we create a OpenShift build that uses our Dockerfile to build the image for the producer.

The [BuildConfig](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html) describes how a single build task is performed. The BuildConfig is primarily characterized by the Build strategy and its resources. For our build, we use the Docker strategy which invokes the Docker build command. Furthermore, it expects a `Dockerfile` in the source repository. If the Dockerfile is not in the root directory, then you can specify the location with the `dockerfilePath`.
Beside we configure the source and the triggers as well. For the source, we can specify any Git repository. This is where the application sources reside. The triggers describe how to trigger the build. In this example, we provide four different triggers. (Generic webhook, GitHub webhook, ConfigMap change, Image change)

Prepare a file inside your workspace `<workspace>/buildConfig.yaml` and add the following resource configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewBuild
  labels:
    build: data-producer
    application: amm-techlab
  name: data-producer
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: data-producer:rest
  postCommit: {}
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "512Mi"
    requests:
      cpu: "250m"
      memory: "512Mi"
  source:
    git:
      uri: https://github.com/puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer.git
      ref: rest
    type: Git
  strategy:
    dockerStrategy:
      dockerfilePath: src/main/docker/Dockerfile.binary
    type: Docker
  triggers:
  - github:
      secret: PPMUkybOXqfoY_bJd-ou
    type: GitHub
  - generic:
      secret: f31PWzHXBGI9iYw-fTli
    type: Generic
  - type: ConfigChange
  - imageChange: {}
    type: ImageChange
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/buildConfig.yaml)

Create the build config.

```BASH
oc apply -f buildConfig.yaml
```

```
buildconfig.build.openshift.io/data-producer created
```

The build starts automatically after creating the buildConfig. See the actual build logs:

```BASH
oc logs data-producer-1-build
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Deploy Application

After the ImageStream and BuildConfig definition, we can set up our DeploymentConfig. The DeploymentConfig defines how our image is run inside OpenShift. The image is referenced by our ImageStream `data-producer` with the `rest` tag.

Prepare a file inside your workspace `<workspace>/deploymentConfig.yaml` and add the following resource configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  annotations:
    image.openshift.io/triggers: '[{"from":{"kind":"ImageStreamTag","name":"data-producer:rest"},"fieldPath":"spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name==\"data-producer\")].image"}]'
  labels:

            periodSeconds: 20
            successThreshhold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 15
          readinessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 5
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
              scheme: HTTP
            initialDelaySeconds: 3
            periodSeconds: 20
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 15
          name: data-producer
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080
            name: http
            protocol: TCP
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "1"
              memory: 200Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 50m
              memory: 100Mi
  triggers:
    - imageChangeParams:
        automatic: true
        containerNames:
          - data-producer
        from:
          kind: ImageStreamTag
          name: data-producer:rest
      type: ImageChange
    - type: ConfigChange
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/deploymentConfig.yaml)

Let's create the deployment with the following command

```BASH
oc apply -f deploymentConfig.yaml
```

```
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/data-producer created
```

When you check your project in the web console (Developer view) the example app is visible.
The pod will be deployed successfully when the build finishes and the application image is pushed to the image stream. Please note this might take several minutes.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5: Create Service

Services are used as bridges between the container and the OpenShift project. They enable access from an OpenShift project to the port of a container.

Expose the container ports to the cluster with a Service. For the Service, we configure the port `8080` for the Web API. We set the Service type to ClusterIP to expose the Service cluster internal only.

Prepare a file inside your workspace `<workspace>/svc.yaml` and add the following resource configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: data-producer
  labels:
    application: amm-techlab
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 8080-tcp
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    deploymentConfig: data-producer
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: ClusterIP
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/svc.yaml)

Create the Service in OpenShift

```bash
oc apply -f svc.yaml
```

```
service/data-producer created
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.6: Create Route

Create a Route to expose the service at a hostname. This will make the application available outside of the cluster.

The TLS type is set to Edge. That will configure the router to terminate the SSL connection and forward it to the service with HTTP.

Prepare a file inside your workspace `<workspace>/route.yaml` and add the following resource configuration:

```YAML
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  labels:
     application: amm-techlab
  name: data-producer
spec:
  port:
    targetPort: 8080-tcp
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: data-producer
    weight: 100
  tls:
    termination: edge
  wildcardPolicy: None
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/route.yaml)


Create the Route in OpenShift

```bash
oc apply -f route.yaml
```

```
route.route.openshift.io/data-producer created
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.7: Verify deployed resources

Now we can list all resources in our project to double-check if everything is up and running.
Use the following command to display all resources within our project.

```BASH
oc get all
```

```

## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.9: Access application by browser

Finally, you can visit your application with the URL provided from the Route: <https://data-producer-userXY.techlab.openshift.ch/data>

{{% alert  color="primary" %}}Replace **userXY** with your username or get the URL from your route.{{% /alert %}}

When you open the URL you should see the producers data

```json
{"data":0.6681209742895893}
```

If you only see `Your new Cloud-Native application is ready!`, then you forget to append the `/data`path to the URL.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.10: Deploy consumer application

Now it's time to deploy the counterpart. The consumer application consists of three resource definitions. First we create a deployment, pointing to the consumer Docker Image on docker Hub. Next the service which exposes the application inside our cluster and last the route to access the app from outside the cluster.

We get the needed [consumer.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/consumer.yaml) by curl. Execute the following command inside your workspace:

```BASH
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/02.0/2.1/consumer.yaml --output consumer.yaml
```

This should have created the file `<workspace>/consumer.yaml`.

Use the following command to deploy the data-consumer application:


```BASH
oc apply -f  consumer.yaml
```

```
deployment.apps/data-consumer created
service/data-consumer created
route.route.openshift.io/data-consumer created
```

Let's verify if everything was deployed and is up running.

```BASH
oc get all
```

## Solution

The needed resource files are available inside the folder *manifests/02.0/2.1/*.

When you were not successful, you can update your project with the solution by executing this command:

```BASH
oc apply -f manifests/02.0/2.1/
```
