  Application Monitoring with Prometheus und Grafana

## Collecting Application Metrics

When running applications in production, a fast feedback loop is a key factor. The following reasons show why it's essential to gather and combine all sorts of metrics when running an application in production:

* To make sure that an application runs smoothly
* To be able to see production issues and send alerts
* to debug an application
* to take business and architectural decisions
* metrics can also help to decide on how to scale applications

Application Metrics provide insights into what is happening inside our Quarkus Applications using the [MicroProfile Metrics](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics) specification.

Those Metrics (e.g. Request Count on a specific URL) are collected within the application and then can be processed with tools like Prometheus for further analysis and visualization.

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a monitoring system and timeseries database which integrates great with all sorts of applications and platforms.

The basic principle behind Prometheus is to collect metrics using a polling mechanism. There are a lot of different so-called [exporters](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#exporters-and-integrations), where metrics can be collected from.

In our case, the metrics will be collected from a specific path provided by the application (`/metrics`)


## Architecture

On our lab cluster, a Prometheus / Grafana stack is already deployed. Using the service discovery capability of the Prometheus - Kubernetes integration the running Prometheus server will be able to locate our application almost out of the box.

* Prometheus running in the namespace `pitc-infra-monitoring`
* Prometheus must be able to collect Metrics from the running application, by sending GET Requests (Network Policy)
* Prometheus must know where to go and where to collect the metrics from


## Annotation vs. Service Monitor

In an early stage of Prometheus - Kubernetes integration, the configuration has been done by annotations. The Prometheus - Kubernetes integration worked by reading specific configured annotations from Kubernetes resources. The informations form those annotations helped the Prometheus Server to find the endpoints to collect Metrics from.

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/scheme: http
    prometheus.io/port: "8080"
```

The current OpenShift - Prometheus integration works differently and is way more flexible. It bases on the ServiceMonitor CustomResource.

```bash
oc explain ServiceMonitor
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Check project setup

We first check that the project is ready for the lab.

Ensure that the `LAB_USER` environment variable is set.

```bash
echo $LAB_USER
```

If the result is empty, set the `LAB_USER` environment variable.

{{% details title="command hint" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
export LAB_USER=<username>
```

{{% /details %}}


Change to your main Project.

{{% details title="command hint" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc project $LAB_USER
```

{{% /details %}}

> Don't forget to deploy/update your resources with the git instead of the oc command for this lab.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Create Service Monitor

Let's now create our first ServiceMonitor.

Create the following ServiceMonitor resource as local file `<workspace>/servicemonitor.yaml`.

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="manifests/05.0/5.1/servicemonitor.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/05.0/5.1/servicemonitor.yaml)

Let ArgoCD create the ServiceMonitor by adding the file to git and push it.

{{% details title="command hint" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
git add servicemonitor.yaml && git commit -m "Add ServiceMonitor Manifest" && git push
```

{{% /details %}}

In hurry and do not want to wait for ArgoCD to sync? Do it manually by applying the file.

{{% details title="command hint" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```BASH
oc apply -f servicemonitor.yaml
```

{{% /details %}}

Expected result: `servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/amm-techlab-monitor created`

{{% alert title="Warning" color="secondary" %}}
Your current user must have the following rights in the current namespace: `oc policy add-role-to-user monitoring-edit <user> -n <username>`
Tell your trainer if you get a permission error while creating the ServiceMonitor
{{% /alert %}}


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Verify whether the Prometheus Targets gets scraped or not

Prometheus is integrated into the OpenShift Console under the Menu Item Monitoring.
But as part of this lab, we want to use Grafana to interact with prometheus.
Open Grafana (URL provided by the trainer) and switch to the explore tab, then execute the following query to check whether your target is configured or not:

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Make sure to replace `<username>` with your current namespace
{{% /alert %}}


```s
prometheus_sd_discovered_targets{config="<username>/amm-techlab-monitor/0"}
```

Expected result on the bottom of the Graf: two targets (Consumer and provider) similar to:

```
prometheus_sd_discovered_targets{cluster="cluster",config="<username>/amm-techlab-monitor/0",endpoint="metrics",instance="10.129.2.229:9091",job="prometheus-user-workload",name="scrape",namespace="openshift-user-workload-monitoring",pod="prometheus-user-workload-1",prometheus="openshift-monitoring/k8s",service="prometheus-user-workload"}
prometheus_sd_discovered_targets{cluster="cluster",config="<username>/amm-techlab-monitor/0",endpoint="metrics",instance="10.129.2.255:9091",job="prometheus-user-workload",name="scrape",namespace="openshift-user-workload-monitoring",pod="prometheus-user-workload-0",prometheus="openshift-monitoring/k8s",service="prometheus-user-workload"}
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: How does it work

The Prometheus Operator "scans" namespaces for ServiceMonitor CustomResources. It then updates the ServiceDiscovery configuration accordingly.

The selector part in the Service Monitor defines in our case which services will be auto discovered.

```yaml
# servicemonitor.yaml
...
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      application: amm-techlab
...
```

And the corresponding Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: data-producer
  labels:
    application: amm-techlab
...
```

This means Prometheus scrapes all Endpoints where the `application: amm-techlab` label is set.

The `spec` section in the ServiceMonitor resource allows us now to further configure the targets Prometheus will scrape.
In our case Prometheus will scrape:

* every 30 seconds
* look for a port with the name `http` (this must match the name in the Service resource)
* it will srcape the path `/metrics` using `http`

This means now: since all three Services `data-producer`, `data-consumer` and `data-transformer` have the matching label `application: amm-techlab`, a port with the name `http` is configured and the matching pods provide metrics on `http://[Pod]/metrics`, Prometheus will scrape data from these pods.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5: Query Application Metrics

Since the Metrics are now collected from all three services, let's execute a query and visualise the data.
For example, the total amount of Produced, Consumed and Transformed Messages.

```s
sum(application_ch_puzzle_quarkustechlab_reactiveproducer_boundary_ReactiveDataProducer_producedMessages_total{namespace="<username>"})
```

Then click `Add Query` and enter the transformed messages query.

```s
sum(application_ch_puzzle_quarkustechlab_reactivetransformer_boundary_ReactiveDataTransformer_messagesTransformed_total{namespace="<username>"})
```

Add another query with `Add Query` and enter the consumed messages query.

```s
sum(application_ch_puzzle_quarkustechlab_reactiveconsumer_boundary_ReactiveDataConsumer_consumedMessages_total{namespace="<username>"})
```

Finally click `Run Query` to execute the queries.


{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Make sure to replace `<username>` with your current namespace.
You can ignore the warning about the rate/sum function after you execute the query.
{{% /alert %}}


## Solution

The needed resource files are available inside the folder [manifests/05.0/5.1/](https://github.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/tree/master/manifests/05.0/5.1/) of the techlab [github repository](https://github.com/puzzle/amm-techlab).

If you weren't successful, you can update your project with the solution by cloning the Techlab Repository `git clone https://github.com/puzzle/amm-techlab.git` and executing this command:

```s
oc apply -f manifests/05.0/5.1/
```
